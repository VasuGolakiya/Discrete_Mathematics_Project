                        &emsp;&emsp;  Cryptography is used in almost every aspect of our daily life. We use it to securely communicate passwords over large networks for online shopping, for example. Cryptography is the technique of safeguarding data by converting it into a format that only those who know how it was encoded can decipher. The plaintext version of the information is known as plaintext, and the encoded version is known as ciphertext. The process of converting plaintext to ciphertext is known as encryption, and the calculation or code used to do so is known as an algorithm. Decryption is the reversal of encryption, converting ciphertext back to plaintext or another readable format.<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;  Cryptography is a critical tool for preventing this from occurring. It protects data and communications by enforcing a set of rules that allow only those who are supposed to receive the data to access and process it.

                    <p class="section-content">
                    &emsp;&emsp;  Cryptography, or the use of codes and cyphers to keep secrets safe, has been practised for thousands of years. Until recently, it has been the narrative of what is known as conventional cryptography, or encryption methods that rely on pen and paper or perhaps basic mechanical aids. The invention of complex mechanical and electromechanical machines, such as the Enigma rotor machine, provided more sophisticated and efficient means of encryption in the early twentieth century, and the subsequent introduction of electronics and computing has allowed elaborate schemes of even greater complexity, the majority of which are unsuited to pen and paper.<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp; Cryptanalysis — the "breaking" of codes and cyphers — has evolved in lockstep with cryptography. The early discovery and use of frequency analysis to the reading of encrypted communications has changed the course of history on several occasions.

                    <p class="section-content">
                    &emsp;&emsp; RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptosystem for secure data transmission. It's also one of the most historic. The initials RSA stand for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who first published the technique in 1977.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp; The encryption key is public and separate from the decryption key, which is kept hidden in a public-key cryptosystem (private). An RSA user generates and distributes a public key using two huge prime integers and an auxiliary value. The prime numbers are a closely guarded secret. Messages can be encrypted by anyone using the public key, but only those who know the prime numbers can decode them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;The "factoring problem," which is the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two huge prime numbers, is at the heart of RSA's security. The RSA problem refers to the difficulty of breaking RSA encryption. It's unclear whether it'll be as complex as the factoring problem. If a large enough key is utilised, there are no published methods to circumvent the system.

                                &emsp;&emsp; Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman created the Diffie-Hellman algorithm in 1976. As a result, Diffie Hellman was born. Furthermore, despite its name, this algorithm is not used to encrypt data; rather, it is used to generate a secret key between the sender and the recipient.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                &emsp;&emsp;Asymmetric encryption necessitates the exchange of a private key between the data transmitter and receiver. The safe and secure transfer of the secret key between the sender and the recipient is one of the most difficult aspects of Asymmetric Encryption. During the transfer, no one should have access to or intercept the private key. The Diffie-Hellman algorithm aided this transfer or rather production of the secret key on both sides.

                            <p>&#9830; &emsp;Let’s understand how the Diffie-Hellman Algorithm works &#8594; </p>
                            <div>

                                    1. Let's suppose four variables for the sake of understanding the algorithm: one prime number P, another number G with no factor in common with P, and two private values a and b.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    2. P and G are available to the public. Two users, Alice and Bob, choose private values a and b, respectively, and generate their key for public exchange. The second person receives the key and uses it to generate a secret key. Alice and Bob now have the same secret key to encrypt with.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    3. Both Alice and Bob generates key as follows : <br>
                                    &emsp; X = G<sup>a</sup> mod P <br>
                                    &emsp; Y = G<sup>b</sup> mod P
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    4. Now the keys are exchanged. Alice receives Y and Bob receives X.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    5. Secret key is generated as follows: <br>
                                    &emsp; K<sub>a</sub> = Y<sup>a</sup> mod P <br>
                                    &emsp; K<sub>b</sub> = X<sup>b</sup> mod P
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    6. Algebraically, K<sub>a</sub> = K<sub>b</sub>

                            &emsp; We can find cyclic subgroups of points such that if we add any two points or multiply a point by a number in a cyclic subgroup, the result will be within that same cyclic subgroup. There is no overlap between any two cyclic subgroups. If each cyclic subgroup contains r points, then <i>the cofactor of the curve is h = n/r</i>. It is better to have less cofactor for security efficiency ideally <i>h should be 1</i> &rAarr; All points on the curve should be in a single cyclic group.</p>

                    <p class="section-content">
                        &emsp;&emsp; Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman is a key agreement protocol that enables two parties to create a shared secret via an unsecured channel and each have an elliptic-curve public-private key pair. This shared information can either be utilised directly as a key or to create another key. Subsequent communications can subsequently be encrypted with a symmetric-key cypher utilising the key, or the key that was obtained from it. Using elliptic-curve cryptography, it is a Diffie-Hellman protocol variation. Here, Alice and Bob created a shared secret point R. Eve knows A,B and G but for large groups she cannot solve the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem to obtain β or α and therefore point R.

                            &emsp; Elliptic curve cryptography can be used to establish a secure client authentication system. For example, if Bob is a server and Alice is a client computer, they would first agree upon setting curve parameters, prime and generator point, in order to obtain a larger subgroup. Once key sharing protocols have been initiated, a key will be generated. The server will store this key as an identity of the client, and the client will store it as a passkey to access the server. In this way, both parties will be able to identify each other every time the client wants service.<br>
                            &emsp; The new programming contest platform will use cryptocurrency as its base. This will enable people to earn cryptocurrency by solving problems, writing contests, and being awarded special badges and stickers for solving certain problems. These same people will also be able to buy and sell badges and stickers in exchange for cryptocurrency in our online auctions. The platform will serve as a great resource for people wanting to learn about programming and cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the platform will be beneficial for those looking to gain some economic skills. The data necessary for all this will be stored on the server under the account holder's name. However, it can only be accessed if the server correctly identifies it using the method described above. </p>
